# img_an_pat_rec
This repository contains a project and the labs in the course Image Analysis and Pattern Recognition at EPFL, 2019. All code was
written using Python.

## Project
The project uses different methods to detect whether there is varroas in images of beehives and where in the image they are.
Varroas are dangerous insects which may harm the beehive. The methods used were segmentation by thresholding, detecting contours
using Fourier descriptors, as well as machine learning methods such as MLP and CNN.
